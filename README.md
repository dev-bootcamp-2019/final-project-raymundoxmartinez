This project is a simple market place that allows users to add items that are for sale to their store.

It also allows users to buy items.

To start the app on a local server follow the following steps:
1. ganache-cli
2. truffle compile
3. truffle migrate
4. add mnemonic to metamask
5. navigate to /client
6. npm i
7. npm start
8. on your browser you will see the login page
9. click enter
10. click on the cross to begin adding items
    ***make sure the image you are adding is small about 6kbs***
    ***the smaller the better***
11. you will be prompted by metamask to accept the transaction
12. you can then test the buy functionality by clicking on the buy button
13. you will then again be prompted by metamask to accept the transaction
14. the bought item's button has been disabled

That's all. Thanks!
