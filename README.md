This project is a simple market place that allows users to add items that are for sale to their store.

It also allows users to buy items.

To start the app on a local server follow the following steps:
- run "npm install" in the root directory
- ganache-cli
- truffle compile
- truffle migrate
- add mnemonic to metamask
- navigate to /client
- npm install
- npm start
- on your browser you will see the login page
- click enter
- click on the cross to begin adding items
  ***make sure the image you are adding is small about 6kbs***
  ***the smaller the better***
- you will be prompted by metamask to accept the transaction
- you can then test the buy functionality by clicking on the buy button
- you will then again be prompted by metamask to accept the transaction
- the bought item's button has been disabled
- run test with "truffle test"
That's all. Thanks!
